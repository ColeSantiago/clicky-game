** The object of the game is not click all of the pictures without clicking one twice. **

Each time one is clicked the user's score will increment by one.

If a picture is clicked more then once in the same game the game will end and the user's top score will be recorded on the top of the screen. 

The game restarts by just clicking another picture.
